If you have a computer operating issue, there are a few options. You can: Restart the bridge and drive across again (this will clear any ambient fog as well) Check for wind advisories and only drive if the bridge is open to vehicle transit Re-park and re-boot the bridge by driving slowly and allowing the fog to clear.

Finally, if you're looking for a truly unique experience, you can drive across the bridge at night when it's lit up by glow sticks.
